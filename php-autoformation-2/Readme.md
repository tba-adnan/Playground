## PHP autoformation 2 (in depth OOP) ReadMe :


- Abstracts : define a function and use it in multiple child classes. (methods accepts propeties.), (no written code in method). (abstract methods should exist in abstract classes). 

- Interfaces : all methods are public, methods in interface are abstract. (implement.)

- Traits : Declare multiple methods in one Trait and use it. (use)

- Static methods : can be called in-direct without intializing a class even in another methods.

- Static Properties : same as classic methods but exist as properties.
